# Hospital-App

A simple hospital management system built in C++ that supports patient registration, staff and admin authentication, blood donor management, and patient status tracking. Designed using object oriented programming principles, Data structures, and CMake as a build system.

The purpose of this small project was to go deep into OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritence, polymorphism and abstraction along with Data structures and apply them in a practical system.
